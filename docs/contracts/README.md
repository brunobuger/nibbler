# Contract examples

Nibbler reads the governance contract from `.nibbler/contract/` by merging YAML fragments (sorted by filename). The default writer layout is:

- `team.yaml`: roles, sharedScopes, escalationChain
- `phases.yaml`: phases, gates, globalLifetime

These examples are **commented** and intended as learning/reference material.

## Files

- `team.yaml`: example role definitions and scopes
- `phases.yaml`: example phase graph and a PO gate
