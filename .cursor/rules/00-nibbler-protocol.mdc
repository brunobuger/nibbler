# Nibbler Protocol

When your work is complete, signal the engine by outputting exactly ONE of these single-line events as **plain text in your response**:

```text
NIBBLER_EVENT {"type":"PHASE_COMPLETE","summary":"<short summary>"}
NIBBLER_EVENT {"type":"NEEDS_ESCALATION","reason":"<what blocked you>","context":"<optional>"}
NIBBLER_EVENT {"type":"EXCEPTION","reason":"<product decision needed>","impact":"<impact>"}
```

**IMPORTANT**: The NIBBLER_EVENT line is a protocol signal parsed from your text output.
NEVER write it inside any file (README.md, source code, config, etc.).
It must only appear as text in your response after all file edits are done.
